# Player Re-identification System for Soccer Videos

A comprehensive computer vision solution for tracking and identifying players across multiple camera angles in soccer videos. This system maintains consistent player identities between broadcast and tactical camera views, enabling advanced sports analytics and enhanced viewing experiences.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses the challenging problem of player re-identification in soccer videos, where the same player must be assigned the same unique ID across different camera angles and viewpoints. The system processes two video sources - a broadcast view and a tactical camera view - and creates a unified player identification database.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting distinctive features from detected players
3. **Matching Algorithm**: Correlating players across different camera views
4. **Tracking**: Maintaining consistent IDs throughout the video sequences

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CUDA/GPU Issues**
```bash
# Check CUDA availability
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"

# Force CPU mode if needed
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
```

**2. Memory Issues**
- Reduce `MAX_FRAMES_TO_PROCESS` in config
- Process videos in smaller chunks
- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary files

**3. Detection Quality Issues**
- Adjust `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` in config
- Verify video quality and lighting conditions
- Check for proper camera angles and player visibility

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
python Code/run_detection.py --debug
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Detection Phase**: YOLOv11 processes each frame to detect player bounding boxes
2. **Feature Extraction**: Multi-modal analysis extracts appearance, spatial, and temporal features
3. **Cross-Camera Matching**: Similarity computation and optimal assignment using Hungarian algorithm
4. **ID Assignment**: Graph-based identity clustering ensures consistent IDs across cameras

### Feature Engineering

- **Appearance**: Dominant jersey colors using K-means clustering
- **Spatial**: Normalized field positions and movement vectors
- **Temporal**: Activity patterns and frame consistency scores
- **Quality**: Detection confidence and feature reliability metrics

### Matching Algorithm

The cross-camera matching uses a weighted similarity function:

```
similarity = w1 * appearance_sim + w2 * spatial_sim + w3 * temporal_sim
```

Where weights are optimized based on feature reliability and context.

## 🎨 Visualizations

The system generates various visualizations:

- **Detection Overlays**: Bounding boxes with confidence scores
- **Feature Maps**: Jersey color distributions and spatial patterns
- **Match Visualizations**: Player correspondences between cameras
- **Quality Dashboards**: System performance and validation metrics
